# PetPals Habit Tracker app
A Python-Based CLI habit tracker that gamifies building habits with virtual pets. 
Each habit is paired with a pet: completing habits increases your petâ€™s happiness and XP, while missing habits lowers happiness and breaks streaks.


## What is it?
PetPals is a command-line application written in Python.  
- Users can create, complete, and remove habits.  
- Each habit is linked to a pet species (e.g., cat, dog).  
- Completing habits grows streaks and levels up your pet.  
- Missing habits reduces pet happiness.  
- Analytics provide insights like the **longest streak overall** or the **happiest pet**.  
- All data is saved in JSON files so that progress persists between sessions.
